                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>I began my coding journey a few months into the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior to this, I was working at a gym. I graduated with a B.S. in Kinesiology from the University of San Francisco in 2018. I will be attending Rithm School for their full-stack program starting April of 2021. I'm originally from Daly City, California, but over the years, I've moved around the Bay Area and currently live in Vallejo. I love Bay Area sports, including the 49ers, Warriors, and especially the Giants since I grew up playing baseball.</p>
